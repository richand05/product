# Product API
This API uses the Spring Boot framework to provide an interface for working with a PostgreSQL database. It consists of two main methods: getAllProducts() to get a list of all products stored in the database, and createProduct(ProductDto productDto) to create a new product. The DTO (Data Transfer Object) pattern is used to represent the product data, and Model Mapper is used to map the product objects. This allows for safe and efficient manipulation of product data, while avoiding exposure of the internal structure of the database. Overall, this API provides a scalable and robust solution for working with product data in a PostgreSQL database.
